For example, the target that we want to predict can be a person's systolic blood pressure and age can be the single feature that describes the person. Such a \"small\" problem is not often encountered in practice but it can be very illustrative for this technique (in the project work you will work with a more \"practical\" medical image analysis problem).\n"
