    "### Goal:\n",
    "Develop Python code for point-based and intensity-based (medical) image registration. Ese the developed code to perform image registration and evaluate and analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that you will be using in the first mini-project originates from the [MRBrainS medical image analysis challenge](http://mrbrains13.isi.uu.nl/). It consists of 30 transverse slices of MR brain scans with two different sequences: T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR (5 patients $\\times$ 3 slices per patient $\\times$ 2 modalities). Please see the **Getting started** assignment below for more details on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "Code and a report describing your implementation, results and analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no hard limit for the length of the report, however, concise and short reports are **strongly** encouraged. Aim to present your most important findings in the main body of the report and (if needed) any additional information in an appendix. The following report structure is suggested for the main body of the report:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "2. Methods\n",
    "3. Results\n",
    "4. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction and result sections can be very brief in this case (e.g. half a page each). The discussion section should contain the analysis of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report must be submitted as a single PDF file. The code must be submitted as a single archive file (e.g. zip) that is self-contained and can be used to reproduce the results in the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is not a single correct solution for the project. You have to demonstrate to the reader that you understand the methods that you have studied and can critically analyze the results of applying the methods. Below, you can find a set of assignments (guided project work) that will help you get started with the project work and when correctly completed will present you with a **minimal solution**. Solutions which go beyond these assignments are of course encouraged. python \n",

    "### 1. Dataset\n",
    "The image dataset is located in the [image_dataset](../images/image_data/) subfolder of the code for the registration exercises and project. The image filenames have the following format: `{Patient ID}_{Slice ID}_{Sequence}.tif`. For example, the filename `3_2_t1.tif` is the second slice from a T1-weighted scan of the third patient. Every T1 slice has two versions: original and transformed with some random transformation that can be identified with the `_d` suffix in the filename. This simulates a registration problem where you have to register two image acquisitions of the same patient (note however that some of the transformations that were used to simulate the second set of images are not realistic for brain imaging, e.g. brains usually do not have shearing between acquisitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this dataset we can define two image registration problems: T1 to T1 registration (e.g. register `3_2_t1_d.tif` to `3_2_t1.tif`) and T2 to T1 registration (e.g. register `3_2_t2.tif` to `3_2_t1.tif`). Which one of these can be considered inter-modal image registration and which one intra-modal image registration?"
